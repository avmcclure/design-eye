        <h3>1979 to 1983: Action Film Star</h3>
        <span>
          In 1979, Norris starred in A Force of One, where he played Matt Logan,
          a world karate champion who assists the police in their investigation.
          The film was developed while touring for Good Guys Wear Black. Again
          no studio wanted to pick it up, but it out-grossed the previous film
          by making $20 million at the box office.

          In 1980, he released The Octagon, where his character must stop a
          group of terrorists trained in the ninja style. Unlike his previous
          films this time the studios were interested. American Cinema Releasing
          distributed it and it made almost $19 million at the box office.

        <span>
          In 1981, he starred in Steve Carver's An Eye for an Eye, co-starring
          Christopher Lee, Richard Roundtree, Matt Clark, and Mako Iwamatsu.

          The following year he had the lead in the action horror film Silent
          Rage (1982) it was his first film released by a major studio Columbia
          Pictures. In the film Norris is a sheriff who must stop a psychopath
          who goes on a rampage after being granted near-indestructibility in a
          medical experiment.

          Shortly afterward MGM gave him a three-movie deal, and that same year
          they released Forced Vengeance (1982). Norris was unhappy with the
          direction they wanted to take with him, hence the contract was
          canceled.

          In 1983, Norris made Lone Wolf McQuade with Orion Pictures. He played
          J.J. McQuade, a reckless Texas Ranger who'd rather work alone, but who
          gets a new partner because his captain would like to have him
          supervised. The partners investigate an arms dealer played by David
          Carradine. The film was a worldwide hit and had a positive reception
          from movie critics, often being compared to Sergio Leone's stylish
          spaghetti westerns. The film became the inspiration for Norris's
          future hit TV show Walker, Texas Ranger. Film critic Roger Ebert gave
          the film a 3.5 star rating, calling the character of J.J. McQuade
          worthy of a film series and predicting the character would be a future
          classic.

          The same year, he also published his second book about general
          exercising called Toughen Up! the Chuck Norris Fitness System.

          Also in 1983, Xonox produced the video game Chuck Norris Superkicks
          for the Commodore 64, Commodore VIC-20, Atari 2600, and Colecovision.
          The game combines two types of gameplay: moving through a map, and
          fighting against enemies. The player takes control of Chuck Norris who
          has to liberate a hostage. It was later sold as Kung Fu Superkicks
          when the license for the use of the name Chuck Norris expired.

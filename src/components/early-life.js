      <h3>Early Life</h3>
      <span>
        Norris was born in Ryan, Oklahoma on March 10, 1940 to Wilma (n√©e
        Scarberry) and Ray Dee Norris, who was a World War II Army soldier, a
        mechanic, bus driver, and truck driver. Norris has stated that he has
        Irish and Cherokee roots. Norris was named after Carlos Berry, his
        father's minister. He was the oldest of three brothers, the younger two
        being Wieland, and Aaron (a Hollywood producer). When Norris was
        sixteen, his parents divorced, and he later relocated to Prairie
        Village, Kansas and then to Torrance, California with his mother and
        brothers.

        Norris has described his childhood as downbeat. He was nonathletic, shy,
        and scholastically mediocre. His father, Ray, worked intermittently as
        an automobile mechanic, and went on alcohol drinking binges that lasted
        for months at a time. Embarrassed by his father's behavior and the
        family's financial plight, Norris developed a debilitating introversion
        that lasted for his entire childhood.

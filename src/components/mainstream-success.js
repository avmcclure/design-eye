    <span>
      In 1984, Norris starred in Missing in Action, the first of a series of POW
      rescue fantasies themed around the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue that were
      produced by Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus and released under their Cannon
      Films banner, with which he had signed a multiple movie deal. He plays
      Colonel James Braddock, a US military officer who spent seven years in a
      North Vietnamese POW camp, which he escaped 10 years ago. After the war,
      Braddock accompanies a government investigation team that travels to Ho
      Chi Minh City to investigate reports of US soldiers still held prisoner.
      Norris later dedicated these films to his younger brother Wieland, who was
      a private in the 101st Airborne Division, and had been killed in June 1970
      in Vietnam while on patrol in the defense of Firebase Ripcord. The
      film was a huge success and Norris became Cannon's most prominent star of
      the 1980s.

      In 1985, Cannon Films released Missing in Action 2: The Beginning and
      Invasion U.S.A. which were extremely successful. Missing in Action 2: The
      Beginning is a prequel to the first installment, where Colonel James
      Braddock is held in a North Vietnamese POW camp run by sadistic Colonel,
      who forces the POWs to grow opium for a French drug runner, and tries to
      get Braddock to admit to and sign a long list of war crimes. During his
      team's time in captivity, they are relentlessly subjected to various forms
      of torture. This leads them to attempt escape, and Braddock plots to free
      his fellow prisoners and destroy the prison camp.

      Invasion U.S.A. takes place during the Cold War area. Rostov, a Soviet
      operative leads a band of Latin American communist guerrillas to invade
      Florida. The invasion force spreads out into the South and causes havoc by
      shooting bazookas into suburban homes, inciting race riots by
      impersonating the police and attacking ethnic events, and planting bombs
      in churches and on school buses. With terror spreading everywhere, martial
      law is declared. Norris plays a former CIA agent who has had previous
      encounters with Rostov, and can take him on.

      That same year Orion Pictures released Code of Silence which received
      positive reviews and was also a box office success. Code
      of Silence is a crime drama, and features Norris as a streetwise
      plainclothes officer who takes down a crime czar responsible for officers
      being wounded in a botched drug raid. It's considered by fans and critics
      as Chuck Norris's best film to date.

        1958 to 1968: United States Air Force and Martial Arts Breakthrough
      </h3>
      <span>
        He joined the United States Air Force as an Air Policeman (AP) in 1958
        and was sent to Osan Air Base, South Korea. It was there that Norris
        acquired the nickname Chuck and began his training in Tang Soo Do
        (tangsudo), an interest that led to black belts in that art and the
        founding of the Chun Kuk Do ("Universal Way") form. When he returned to
        the United States, he continued to serve as an AP at March Air Force
        Base in California.

        Norris was discharged from the U.S. Air Force in August 1962. Following
        his military service, Norris applied to be a police officer in Torrance,
        California. While on the waiting list, Norris opened a martial arts
        studio. To promote it, Norris did demonstrations and fights in all kinds
        of events.

        Norris started to participate in martial arts competitions. He was
        defeated in his first two tournaments, dropping decisions to Joe Lewis
        and Allen Steen. He lost three matches at the International Karate
        Championships to Tony Tulleners. By 1967 Norris had improved enough that
        he scored victories over the likes of Vic Moore. On June 3rd, at the
        1967 tournament of karate, Norris defeated seven opponents, exchanged
        his final blows with Skipper Mullins, and won the tournament. On June
        24th, Norris was declared champion at the S. Henry Cho's All-American
        Karate Championship at the Madison Square Garden, taking the title from
        Julio LaSalle and defeating Joe Lewis. During this time, Norris also
        worked for the Northrop Corporation and opened a chain of karate
        schools, including a storefront school in his then-hometown of Torrance,
        CA on Hawthorne Boulevard. Norris's official website lists celebrity
        clients at the schools; among them Steve McQueen, Chad McQueen, Bob
        Barker, Priscilla Presley, Donny Osmond and Marie Osmond.

        In early 1968, Norris suffered the tenth and last loss of his career,
        losing an upset decision to Louis Delgado. On November 24, 1968, he
        avenged his defeat to Delgado and by doing so won the Professional
        Middleweight Karate champion title, which he held for six consecutive
        years. On April 1, it was reported that, in a round robin tournament,
        Norris successfully defended his All-American Karate Championship title
        at the Karate tournament of champions of North America Sunday against
        both Hawk D. Frazier and Carlos Farrell, winners of the black belt
        lightweight and heavyweight titles, respectively. Again that year,
        Norris won for the second time the All-American Karate Championship. It
        was the last time Norris participated and retired undefeated. While
        competing, Norris met Bruce Lee, who at the time was known for the TV
        series The Green Hornet. They developed a friendship, as well as a
        training and working relationship.

        In 1969, during the first weekend of August, Norris defended his title
        as world champion at the International Karate Championship. The
        competition included champions from most of the fifty states as well as
        a half dozen from abroad who joined for the preliminaries. Norris
        retained his title. Norris won Karate's triple crown for the most
        tournament wins of the year, and the Fighter of the Year award by Black
        Belt magazine. That year, Norris made his acting debut in the Dean
        Martin film The Wrecking Crew.
